# The Chess Project

### *A kinda functional chessboard*

# NOTE: GOTTA UPDATE THIS TO SCP DATABASE

This application will:
- Be a fully functioning chessboard
- Be multiplayer (within the device, no network connection)
- Show a player's possible moves for each piece
- Show a nice representation of captured pieces 
- Be able to save games and load them later
- Have the ability to place pieces in whatever starting position the players like, allowing for strange new variants 
(Similar to the mobile game "Really Bad Chess")


Chess is a game that has remained relevant and entertaining for centuries. I aim to create this chess application to 
improve my skills in Java, but I am also doing this to learn more about chess.

### User Stories - Stage 1 (Don't forget to move this after!!!):
- As a user, I would like to load a chessboard with the default piece layout.
- I would like to tell the pieces where to move according to the rules of chess.
- I would like to control both sides of the board from my device.
- I would like to be able to capture a piece, and add it to a list of captures.

# The SCP Database

#### SCP stands for Secure, Contain, Protect. 
#### It is a community-driven database of fictional entities which possess anomalous properties.
#### These are referred to as "SCPs".

This application will:
- Be a catalogue of various different "SCPs", each being designated a unique number.
- Allow the user to add descriptions, containment procedures, danger levels, and extra information on every SCP.
- Provide the ability to add SCPs to a "Favourites" list, which can be browsed and edited.
- Display images for SCPs when available.
- Allow the user to delete or otherwise edit any SCP entry.

*The SCP foundation is one of the largest community projects on the internet. Many people work together to create
an extremely entertaining world of horror. This project is a way to improve my programming skills while learning more
about this project.*

### User Stories - Stage 1:
- As a user, I would like to add an SCP with a number, name, containment procedures, description, object classification,
and any additional notes.
- I would like to be able to edit the information above for any existing SCP except for its number.
- I would like to be able to delete an SCP from the catalogue.
- I should be able to view all existing SCPs at once.

# The Chess Project

### *A fully functional chessboard*

This application will:
- Be a fully functioning chessboard
- Be multiplayer
- Show a player's possible moves for each piece
- Show a nice representation of captured pieces 
- Be able to save games as Algebraic Notation<sup>(1)</sup> (Chess Notation)
- Be able to load games from Algebraic Notation
- Have the ability to place pieces in whatever starting position the players like, allowing for strange new variants 
(see: Really Bad Chess)
- Have optional fun toggles, such as making en-passant mandatory, or disabling castling


Chess is a game that has remained relevant and entertaining for centuries. I aim to create this chess application to 
improve my skills in Java, but I am also doing this to learn more about chess.

### User Stories (Don't forget to delete this after!!!):
- As a user, I would like to load a chessboard with the default piece layout.
- I would like to tell the pieces where to move according to the rules of chess.
- I would like to control both sides of the board from my device.
- I would like to be able to capture a piece, and add it to my list of captures.
